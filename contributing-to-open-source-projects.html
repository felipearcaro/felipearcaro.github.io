<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>I have made my initial foray into the realm of open-source contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner/pull/280">Airflow - Dynamic DAGs example to MWAA local</a></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I have always been passionate about the open-source world. The majority of my current job relies heavily on open-source tools and packages. In fact, it is remarkable to acknowledge that a significant portion of the internet operates on open-source code.</p>
<p>However, I must say that I never truly comprehended why people would invest countless hours in building software merely for the sake of creation – that is, until I built my first website.</p>
<p>The high I got from building something out of thin air was amazing, even though it was poorly designed and nobody was going to use it. In fact, at times, I find the process of shipping a product with real users to be as fun as creating something that exclusively solves a problem for myself and perhaps for some of my friends.</p>
<p>I never really considered myself a good-enough engineer to contribute to an open-source project, though, and even browsing through open-source repositories was overwhelming and daunting.</p>
<p>However, this month, I decided to change that. I am proud to present my inaugural open-source contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-mwaa-local-runner/pull/280">Airflow - Dynamic DAGs example to MWAA local</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While it may not be a feat of engineering genius, and a significant portion of the code already existed elsewhere, hopefully it will help someone out there – or, at the very least, confuse a few robots lurking in the depths of the crazy interwebs.</p>
